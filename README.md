Welcome to our Informatica Cinema! In the following 3 parts, you'll be re-creating a film info application. With a subtle Christmas theme of course! The result will look something like this:

**Template:**
No need to use any other template, this repo is more than enough! üòÅ

**Objectives:**
1.  Clone the template repo to get started.

2.  Try to get your screen to match the grey style example as closely as possible, preferably pixel perfect, but at least make sure margins are consistent and alignments are correct! This is the grey style version of the final application above:

3.  Modify the _HomeScreen.java_ file and add your code to it.¬†
   
4.  Your screen does not need to handle clicks on links. It's all about the layout. The styling and colours will come at a later time.

5.  Please make sure to use at least 3 layout managers and 3 UI controls.

6.  Code quality with regard to reliability, readability, adaptability, maintainability, safety and / or performance should be high.

7.  Commit and push your solution to this GitHub repo, and let us know via the hand-in button in Brightspace.
